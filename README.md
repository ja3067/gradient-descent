# Gradient Descent

A variety of Tensorflow and Numpy implementations of the gradient descent backpropogation algorithm for simple one and two layer networks.

### Use

The documentation for these programs is rather poor at the moment, and I will be continually updating them with inline documentation, docstrings, and command line argument parsers. For the moment, just download the code, insert the correct path names, and run in a Python interpreter. Examples and demos will also be added shortly.
